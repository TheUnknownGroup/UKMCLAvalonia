# Information
This is the first version, it is still currently in the works but since it is experimental, anyone is allowed to test this and give feedback, which is deeply appreciated.

# Changes and Fixes
Still working on this linux .deb file issue, this possibly will remain as the changelog until further notice.

# Incoming additions
There will be some definitive changes to the GUI the next time there is a release.
